Microsoft BCS/BCS IRSG Karen Spärck Jones Award An Award to Commemorate Karen Spärck Jones The British Computer Society Information Retrieval Specialist Group (BCS IRSG) in conjunction with the BCS created an award in 2008 to commemorate the achievements of Karen Spärck Jones. Karen was a Professor Emerita of Computers and Information at the University of Cambridge and one of the most remarkable women in computer science. Her contributions to the fields of Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially with regard to experimentation, have been outstanding and highly influential. Karen's achievements resulted in her receiving a number of prestigious accolades such as the BCS Lovelace medal for her advancement in Information Systems, and the ACM Salton Award for her significant, sustained and continuing contributions to research in information retrieval. The IRSG is grateful to Microsoft Research for their sponsorship of the Karen Spärck-Jones award. Sponsered by: Recipient of the Karen Spärck Jones award 2017 We are pleased to announce that the Microsoft BCS/BCS IRSG Karen Spärck Jones Award 2017 is to be awarded to: Fernando Diaz Director of Research at Spotify The panel of independent experts in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP) was particularly impressed by his great breadth and excellence of research, his raising of important issues, such as ethical issues, and his service to the community. In addition to that, the fact that Fernando has made major contributions in both IR and NLP is in the very spirit of the award. Congratulations and we are looking forward to an inspiring keynote talk at ECIR 2018 in Grenoble! Recipient of the Karen Spärck Jones award 2016 In 2016, the award panel had the difficult task to decide between a range of candidates with outstanding research credentials, all of which lead an impressive research programme with a view to advance our understanding of IR and/or NLP through experimentation. In giving the award to Jaime Teevan Affiliate Associate Professor at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond, USA the award panel recognises Jaime's technically strong and exceptionally creative contributions to the intersection of information retrieval, user experience and social media. In particular, Jaime has advanced our understanding of information retrieval through her contributions to design, implementation and careful evaluation of new retrieval algorithms and user experiences. Jaime will give a keynote at ECIR 2017. Recipients of the Karen Spärck Jones award 2015 In 2015, the award panel was highly impressed both by the quality and diversity of the field of candidates: it faced a hard time narrowing down the nominations to a short list. Even more so, it turned out the panel experienced a genuine difficulty of deciding between the two candidates who best matched the award criterion "To have endeavoured to advance our understanding of IR and/or NLP through experimentation." As a consequence, and unique to 2015, the panel decided to make two full awards. In alphabetical order: Jordan Boyd-Graber Assistant Professor, Computer Science Department University of Colorado, USA The panel recognised Jordan's technically strong and creative work on probabilistic topic models, in particular, how his work has shown that the semantic coherence of these topics can be systematically assessed, how linguistic knowledge such as word senses, syntactic relations and inter-language relationships can be incorporated - and crucially - how user feedback can easily and iteratively be integrated into learned topic models to improve the semantic coherence of the topics. The panel thought that Jordan has shaped our understanding of NLP in new and important ways through experimental machine learning research. Jordan gave a keynote at ECIR 2016 on interactive machine learning for understanding large document collections. Emine Yilmaz Lecturer, Department of Computer Science University College London, UK The panel was impressed by the body of Emine's research on evaluation techniques to better match the realities of modern information systems, in particular her work on missing user judgments, her proposed new metrics that are more robust to missing data and her work on expected browsing utility as a new evaluation metric derived from interaction patterns of real web search sessions. Her recent work focused on devising and evaluating the quality of task based information retrieval systems, retrieval systems that can help the user complete the task that have led them issue a query to a search engine, as opposed to just retrieving a list of documents relevant to the query submitted. The panel recognized that Emine's research has pushed the field of IR forward in these important aspects and that her work has had a high impact on academia and practice. Emine gave a keynote at ECIR 2016 on a task-based perspective to Information Retrieval. Recipient of the Karen Spärck Jones award 2014 Ryen White Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond, USA The award panel recognises that Ryen White has contributed in many layers to a better understanding of search interaction, eg, through novel and creative analyses of vital and as of yet unexplored aspects of searcher behavior closely coupled with the development of models and applications for improving the search experience. The panel was highly impressed by Ryen's academic output, many as leading or sole author, using experimental methods of large-scale log analyses, user studies and surveys. His sheer productivity, the take-up of his work in academia and a number of best paper awards at prestigious conferences including ACM SIGIR (3x), ACM CIKM, ACM SIGCHI and in JASIST speak for themselves. It is also a hallmark of Ryen's professional activity that he continued to serve the academic community though reviewing, track chairing and PC co-chairing at top conferences, editorial board memberships and guest editing while being a researcher in industry. Ryen gave a keynote at ECIR 2015 on Mining and Modelling Online Health Search. The slides of his lecture are available here Recipient of the 2013 award Eugene Agichtein Associate Professor Mathematics and Computer Science Department Emory University, Atlanta, USA In making the BCS/ BCS IRSG Karen Spärck-Jones Award for 2013, the Panel strongly recognizes that Eugene Agichtein has made several important contributions in search and large scale web text data mining with a focus on user interaction data. Eugene's work has included demonstrating how models of human information interactions can be inferred by leveraging computational techniques on what are large-scale but also noisy behaviour records. His work has been very influential - the depth of which across several areas is impressive. Eugene has focused on understanding and modelling user interaction in web search and collaborative question answering. For example, he has shown that click through and other forms of implicit feedback are useful for improving search results ranking when gathered across large numbers of users. This is one area of contribution where his work is seen as particularly influential. Eugene's work includes mouse movements and prediction of responses to advertising, and has reached out to other domains too. Overall, Eugene Agichtein's work is regarded as that of an excellent experimentalist that recognizes the critical linkages between information theory and experiment. Eugene gave a keynote speech at ECIR 2014. Recipient of the 2012 award Diane Kelly Associate Professor University of North Carolina, NC, USA In making the BCS/ BCS IRSG Karen Spärck-Jones Award for 2012, the Panel strongly recognizes that Diane has made important contributions to: the analysis of information seeking behaviors, and to the development of new experimental methods and systems to support information seeking and analysis. Diane has made several other important contributions to user modeling using implicit indicators of relevance, the development and analysis of interfaces to elicit richer statements of interest, and new methodologies for designing and evaluating interactive retrieval systems. Her strong user-oriented work views users-as-people with cognitive tasks. Diane gave a keynote speech at ECIR 2013. The slides of her talk are available for download No award was made in 2011 Recipient of the 2010 award Evgeniy Gabrilovich Senior Research Scientist and Manager of the NLP & IR Group of Yahoo! Research, California, U.S. Evgeniy gave a keynote speech at ECIR 2011. The abstract of his talk and his bio is available. Recipient of the 2009 award The first recipient of the KSJ award is Mirella Lapata Reader (Assoc Prof) School of Informatics University of Edinburgh Mirella's research has focused on various problems in NLP mostly with an emphasis on statistical methods and text generation applications. She has worked on complex problems like: word sense disambiguation, ambiguity resolution, semantic vector space, story generation, and many others.

Udo Kruschwitz - Research Information Research Interests I am a member of the Language and Computation Group (LAC) here at Essex (most recent 16th LAC Day: 5th October 2017; earlier events:15th LAC Day 2016, 14th LAC Day 2015, 13th LAC Day 2014, 12th LAC Day 2013, 11th LAC Day 2012, 10th LAC Day 2011). My research interests are in natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR) and the implementation of such techniques in real applications. The intelligent directory enquiry assistant (YPA) project is an example (going back quite a few years now ...) where the extraction of information from partially structured data together with engineering issues played major roles in making the YPA a usable online system. I am developing techniques that allow the extraction of conceptual information from document collections and the utilization of such knowledge in retrieval tasks. The type of documents can range from Web pages to newspaper articles or other forms of vaguely/partially structured data. For an example application that we had in place with BT's mobile workforce have a look at our log analysis study. Current Projects / Ongoing Collaboration A five-year ESRC Large Grant on Human Rights in the Era of Big Data is now well underway. The Language and Computation Group (Fox/Poesio/Kruschwitz) plays a significant role in this project which also builds on our links with the Minority Rights Group. Watch this space! A Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) on Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence (IGGI) offering 55 PhD student scholarships over 8 years is being funded by the EPSRC and supported by our 60 industrial partners. The first 12 students were admitted for October 2014, and another 11 in October 2015 and 2016. Our fourth cohort has started in September this year. To find out more explore our students' profiles! The CDT involves the University of York, the University of Essex, Queen Mary, University of London, and Goldsmiths College, University of London. If you want to know more, drop me an email! A three-year Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) project (2014-2017) involving the Minority Rights Group and Essex (Poesio/Kruschwitz) aimed at new systems to support civilian-led monitoring of human-rights violations. The Iraq Ceasefire Portal is one of the major outcomes of the project. The Corpus of Violence Acts in Arabic Social Media is an academic resource, described in more detail in our LREC 2016 paper. A highly successful Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) project (2013-2015) was the starting point for an ongoing collaboration with Signal Media. As the University Lead PI I am pleased that Miguel Martinez-Alvarez who joined us as KTP Associate is now Head of Research at Signal. Here is a timeline of some exciting news in our collaboration: November 2014: Miguel is named a Business Leader of Tomorrow (here is a short video portrait of Miguel ... and more coverage of the event / main actors here). April 2015: Best demo award at ECIR 2015 for Signal demo, and even more exciting: Signal has just announced that it has raised $1.8m growth capital from top tier investors (see Techcrunch). November 2015: Signal project wins Best KTP Partnership Award 2015. February 2016: Project features on InnovateUK's home page again. November 2017: new KTP project confirmed, to start in 2018. Creating anaphorically annotated resources through semantic wikis (AnaWiki) (EPSRC) This project has led to the development of Phrase Detectives, an annotation game aimed at the creation of semantically annotated corpora. The DALI project builds on the findings and lessons learned in PhraseDetectives. Recent Research/Development Projects The SENSEI FP7 project started in November 2013 and finished in November 2016. The one-line aim of the project is to make sense of human-human conversation by, for example, applying advanced natural-language engineering techniques such as anaphora resolution and multi-document summarization. Read about the use of SENSEI technology to predict the Brexit results, or if you prefer to read articles in Polish, have a look at this one. Automatic Adaptation of Knowledge Structures for Assisted Information Seeking (AutoAdapt), a project involving the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Robert Gordon University Aberdeen and the Open University. This project developed and evaluated methods for adapting automatically constructed domain models to the population of users' search or browsing behaviour. Application and large-scale evaluation of the developed methods in two information seeking scenarios - namely, interactive search and browsing - were the focus of this project. PEBL-AI is a project that follows on from the Patient Experience and Public Engagement Blogs (PEBL) project. PEBL-AI will result in an automated interface between clinical commissioner groups (CCGs) and the communities they serve. Development of a career path framework, a KTP project involving the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering and JobServe, the world's first Internet Recruitment Service. Development of an intelligent mail server, a KTP project involving the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering and Active Web Solutions (AWS), an Ipswich based company devoted to cutting edge enterprise information systems.

It can give the base forms of words, their parts of speech, whether they are names of companies, people, etc., normalize dates, times, and numeric quantities, mark up the structure of sentences in terms of phrases and syntactic dependencies, indicate which noun phrases refer to the same entities, indicate sentiment, extract particular or open-class relations between entity mentions, get the quotes people said, etc. Choose Stanford CoreNLP if you need: An integrated NLP toolkit with a broad range of grammatical analysis tools A fast, robust annotator for arbitrary texts, widely used in production A modern, regularly updated package, with the overall highest quality text analytics Support for a number of major (human) languages Available APIs for most major modern programming languages Ability to run as a simple web service Stanford CoreNLP’s goal is to make it very easy to apply a bunch of linguistic analysis tools to a piece of text. A tool pipeline can be run on a piece of plain text with just two lines of code. CoreNLP is designed to be highly flexible and extensible. With a single option you can change which tools should be enabled and disabled. Stanford CoreNLP integrates many of Stanford’s NLP tools, including the part-of-speech (POS) tagger, the named entity recognizer (NER), the parser, the coreference resolution system, sentiment analysis, bootstrapped pattern learning, and the open information extraction tools. Moreover, an annotator pipeline can include additional custom or third-party annotators. CoreNLP’s analyses provide the foundational building blocks for higher-level and domain-specific text understanding applications. Download Stanford CoreNLP can be downloaded via the link below. This will download a large (~500 MB) zip file containing (1) the CoreNLP code jar, (2) the CoreNLP models jar (required in your classpath for most tasks), (3) the libraries required to run CoreNLP, and (4) documentation / source code for the project. Unzip this file, open the folder that results and you’re ready to use it. Download CoreNLP 3.9.0 Alternatively, Stanford CoreNLP is available on Maven Central. Source is available on GitHub. For more information on obtaining CoreNLP, see the download page. To download earlier versions of Stanford CoreNLP or language packs for earlier versions, go to the history page. The table below has jars for the current release with all the models for each language we support. Due to size issues we have divided the English resources into two jars. The English (KBP) models jar contains extra resources needed to run relation extraction and entity linking. Language model jar version Arabic download 3.9.0 Chinese download 3.9.0 English download 3.9.0 English (KBP) download 3.9.0 French download 3.9.0 German download 3.9.0 Spanish download 3.9.0 Human languages supported The basic distribution provides model files for the analysis of well-edited English, but the engine is compatible with models for other languages. In the table above, we provide packaged models for Arabic, Chinese, French, German, and Spanish. We also provide two jars that contain all of our English models, which include various variant models, and in particular models optimized for working with uncased English (e.g., mostly or all either uppercase or lowercase). There is also some third party support for additional languages (and we would welcome more!). You can find out more about using CoreNLP with various human languages on the other human languages page. Programming languages and operating systems Stanford CoreNLP is written in Java; recent releases require Java 1.8+. You need to have Java installed to run CoreNLP. However, you can interact with CoreNLP via the command-line or its web service; many people use CoreNLP while writing their own code in Javascript, Python, or some other language. You can use Stanford CoreNLP from the command-line, via its original Java programmatic API, via the object-oriented simple API, via third party APIs for most major modern programming languages, or via a web service. It works on Linux, macOS, and Windows. License Stanford CoreNLP is licensed under the GNU General Public License (v3 or later; in general Stanford NLP code is GPL v2+, but CoreNLP uses several Apache-licensed libraries, and so the composite is v3+). Note that the license is the full GPL, which allows many free uses, but not its use in proprietary software which is distributed to others. For distributors of proprietary software, CoreNLP is also available from Stanford under a commercial licensing You can contact us at java-nlp-support@lists.stanford.edu. If you don’t need a commercial license, but would like to support maintenance of these tools, we welcome gift funding: use this form and write “Stanford NLP Group open source software” in the Special Instructions.
